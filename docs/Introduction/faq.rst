.. _faq1:

What does UASM64 Library do?
------------------------------

UASM64 Library provides many useful functions for use in any of your x64 assembler projects.

UASM64 Library is a x64 port of the functions from the MASM32 Library that are included with the `MASM32 SDK <https://www.masm32.com>`_.



.. _faq2:

What do I need to do to install UASM64 Library?
-------------------------------------------------

Please follow the :ref:`Installation & Setup<Installation & Setup>` guide for details on how to install the UASM64 Library.


.. _faq3:

How do I add to the UASM64 Library documentation?
---------------------------------------------------

Please follow the :ref:`Contributing<Contributing>` guide for details on how to add to, or edit, the UASM64 Library documentation.


.. _faq4:

Why are the UASM64 Library function names different?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The names of the functions and parameter names in the UASM64 Library compared to the MASM32 Library have been changed to increase readability. Equates are provided in the ``UASM64.inc`` file to map to the new function names - which also helps when porting x86 projects to x64 ones.


.. _faq5:

How do I report a bug?
----------------------

If you should encounter any bugs, please open a new issue on the `UASM64 Library <https://github.com/mrfearless/UASM64-Library>`_ Github repository.
